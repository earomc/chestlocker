# ChestLocker

A simple and light-weight Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin for locking chests and other containers in Minecraft.

Note that just because commits are not frequent, it does not mean that the project is unmaintained. 
The plugin is just very simple and there is rarely anything to be changed.
If you have any issues, report them and I will fix them as fast as I can!
